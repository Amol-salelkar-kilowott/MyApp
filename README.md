 The mean is the average or the most common value in a collection of numbers.
 The median is the middle number in a sorted, ascending or descending, list of numbers and can be more descriptive of that data set than the average.
 The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. A set of data may have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode at all
